Check out the proposed framework via a simple illustration of our analysis

Network features we used:
- degrees_in
- degrees_out
- page_rank
- bfs_moments_1
- bfs_moments_2
- closeness
- kcore
- motifs_3 13 directed variations

Algorithms we used:
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- KMeans and Hierarchical as hard clustering
- DBSCAN and Mixture of Gaussians for soft clustering
